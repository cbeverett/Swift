# Swift
Repository of Swift example programs

The CS193P directory contains implementations of the programming assignments for Stanford's Developing iOS 8 Applications with Swift course as offered in Winter 2015.

The UdacityiOSNano directory contains coursework from the Udacity iOS Nano degree program.

The Exercises directory contains implementations of the exercises presented in the book "Exercises for Programmers" by Brian Hogan (Pragmatic Bookshelf).  I implemented these to facilitate learning Swift.
