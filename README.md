# Swift
Repository of Swift example programs

The CS193P directory contains implementations of the programming assignments for Stanford's Developing iOS 8 Applicatons with Swift course as offered in Winter 2015.

The Exercises directory contains implementations of the exercises presented in the book Exercises for Programmers by Brian Hogan (Pragmatic Bookshelf).  I implemented these to facilitate learning Swift.
